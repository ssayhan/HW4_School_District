## School District Analysis

### Background & Overview

In this project we helped Maria and her supervisor that reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. 
She asked to us replace the math and reading scores for Thomas high School with NaNs while keeping the rest of data intact. Maria would like to repeat the school district analysis that we did in this module and write up a report to describe how these cahnages affected the overall analysis

## Results

We replaced the 9th-grade reading and math scores with NaN and run an analysis accordingly
